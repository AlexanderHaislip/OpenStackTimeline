##Items still in need of clarification:
1. When was the first OpenStack design summit? I've heard that it was the week before OSCON and open only to a small group of select partners. Can someone please provide additional details?
2. Which is a better measure of community participation: lines of code or commits? What metric would you want to see to indicate the increased size of each release?
3. Does anyone know where I can data similar to what's available at Stackalytics.com for the first three releases?
4. When did the OpenStack foundation release its Governance Framework letter? I've nailed it down to March 2012, but want a specific date.
5. The Anso team took a long weekend to create what would become the Nova project. When was that?
6. When was Anso founded? What's the date on the articles of incorporation?

###OpenStack Launches
18 Jul - 22 Jul 2010

<b>18 Jul: Rackspace's Lew Moorman announces the company's intention to open source its cloud software in a blog post:</b>

"Imagine a world where code used by the biggest clouds is freely available to any developer, anywhere.  A world where that code was a standard used to build private clouds as well as a variety of new service offers.  In this world, workloads could be moved around these clouds easily – you could fire your cloud provider for bad service or lack of features, but not have to rewrite the software to do it.Imagine an open source cloud operating system that lifts IT to the next level of innovation, just as Linux drove the web to new heights.Today, we at Rackspace launched an ambitious project called OpenStack that aims to make this new world a reality."

19 Mar 2011 - 25 Mar 2011

<b>Kemp announces his resignation on the NASA blog:</b>

"I thought I had the best of both worlds being a Headquarters employee stationed in Silicon Valley, I actually had the worst of both worlds… no influence when I can't be in all of those meetings at NASA HQ, with no mandate to manage projects at Ames. As budgets kept getting cut and continuing resolutions from Congress continued to make funding unavailable, I saw my vision for the future slowly slip further from my grasp. So, today, I am announcing that I am leaving the place I dreamed of working as a kid to find a garage in Palo Alto to do what I love."

###Rackspace Cloud Powered by OpenStack™ [Beta]
01 Mar 2012

Today the next-generation Cloud Servers, powered by OpenStack™, completed the private Alpha phase and entered the Beta phase. This transition is a huge milestone for OpenStack and for the Open era of the cloud. Through the Alpha program, working with our customers and early users, we have learned a lot. What we have today is their input resulting in substantial improvements – from better API responsiveness to the ability for a single user to concurrently spin up hundreds of servers within minutes.These are concrete steps towards making the OpenStack-based Cloud platform ready for production scale deployments. The Bleta phase will allow us to continue to advance development towards that goal and Rackspace vision and enrich the user experience.

Jim Curry Keynotes OpenStack EMEA: "I think OpenStack had more names than James Bond had love interests. Maybe we should’ve just called it 007. Other ill-fated monikers included Cloudbase, Cloudcontrol, Cloudware, CloudCommander and CloudManager. We even once had an OpenStack logo that had a stack of pancakes.  Luckily we settled on OpenStack, and I think it represents the project very well. I also couldn’t imagine saying that the Rackspace Cloud is powered by CloudCommander."
